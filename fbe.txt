ELEC4546. Investment and trading for engineering students (6 credits)
This course is designed for engineering students who wish to start a career in the financial
industry. The depth of this course will be at senior undergraduate students with good technical
skills are welcome to take. This course helps the students to integrate the technical skills, for
example, programming and statistical analysis, they have learned in other engineering courses
and to develop the basic knowledge, skill sets, and vocabulary that can communicate with the
practitioners in the financial industry. The most important is that students are expected to learn
how to develop market view by analyzing the driving factors of the financial markets to forecast
the movement of financial assets like equities and foreign exchange, which is extremely
important when interviewing for a job in the financial industry.
Then, students are expected to build up the basic knowledge on various financial instruments,
such as, options and futures, as well as quantitative models for investment management and
development of trading strategies. The financial products or instruments include: equities,
46
bonds, options, futures and other derivatives. Also, we will discuss various investment/trading
strategies, such as, VWAP, TWAP, Bollinger Band, RSI, etc.

ELEC4547. Emerging technology for VR/AR (6 credits)
There are many emerging yet interesting parts assisting how human beings visualize and
interact with the digital world, including display systems, optics & electronics, IMUs and
sensors, real-time rendering, tracking, haptics, multimodal human perception and depth
perception, stereo rendering, presence. This course’s emphasis on VR/AR/MR technology.
Course Goals: This is a technical class. Students will learn about all hardware (optics,
electronics, display, microcontroller, ...) and software (JavaScript, WebGL, Python) aspects of
Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR). The goal for this class is to learn all of these aspects
in a hands-on manner. Each assignment is a small piece of a bigger project. The goal for each
student or small team of students is to build a fully functional head mounted display, including
optics, display, IMU, rendering, lens distortion shader, model loader etc., from off-the-shelf
parts. The HMD we will build is inspired by the Oculus DK1. We will NOT learn game
development, but study the fundamental building blocks of VR/AR systems and implement all
of them.

skill and theory in the school into a real-life practical technical project. The aims of the project
are not limited to technical achievement, but also reflected on self-awareness, self-management
and probing the limitation of oneself.
Depending on each project offered by teaching staff, students are usually required to
individually carry out the Project Requirement and Design, Implementation and Evaluation,
Report and Presentation on the selected project. Students are encouraged to explore and lean
his/her own direction of the Project over the year during which project supervisor shall provide
assistance and aids along each Project phase with the students.
Students are required to have meeting and discussion with his/her supervisors on a regular basis,
usually every week or every fortnight. Mid-term Review will be held with both the supervisors
48
and the 2nd examiner in order review the student progress. The final assessment will be based
Project Report, Presentation and Demonstration.
Assessment: 100% continuous assessment
